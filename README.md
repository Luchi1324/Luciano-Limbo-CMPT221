# Luciano-Limbo-CMPT221
My project for CMPT 221. Basic Lost and Found services written in PHP and HTML using MySQL.

All of this is run using the Abyss Web Server X1 application. First get that setup with these files, configure PHP on it, run the limbo.sql script to get the database setup, and then access it via localhost.
